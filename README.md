# 3GWish — Personalized NFT Greeting Cards on Solana

3GWish is a decentralized platform for creating, customizing, and sending unique NFT greeting cards to friends, partners, or yourself. Each card is stored on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and longevity.

## Project Goal

To give people a new way to express emotions through NFTs. We are combining emotional connection and Web3 to make digital gifts not just a transaction, but a memorable experience.

## Key Features

- AI/UX-oriented approach: the user enters a message — we automatically generate a unique NFT greeting card.
- Templates + Custom: a selection of ready-made templates (birthday, holidays, romantic) or the ability to upload your own image.
- 1-click minting: NFT creation happens entirely on the client-side via the Phantom wallet.
- Gifting: automatic sending of an NFT greeting card to another user.
- Activity mechanics: users receive bonus NFTs for regular use (gamification).
